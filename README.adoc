== historical_etf_data
For my personal interest I am collecting the historical 10-top positions in selected ETFs.
I was interested in the past how the positions change over time and was not able to find it somewhere.
If you are interested to create some nice visualization I am interested to hear of.
If you find a place where I can find that information, please let me know.

There is no guarantee that the collected data is correct.

== Using

There is a database which has all the data in it.
You can query the database.

* starting the database - `docker-compose up`
* open db connection and execute ddl from src/main/resources/db-migrations
